\subsection{What is Reverse Engineering and what is it used for}
Reverse engineering is the process or method through which a person tries to understand the inner workings of a device, process, system or software to further understand how it accomplishes tasks. In basic terms it is the process of disassembling or dissecting an object to see how it works and find out ways to improve it or exploit a found error. In this project we focus on its aspects in software - and computer engineering. In these sections of science, reverse engineering is used by multiple parties to find mistakes in the software's code or its execution and exploit or fix them.
