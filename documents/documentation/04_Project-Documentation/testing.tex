\subsubsection{Testing}
\subsubsection{Procedure}
To be sure that our defined Labs have a high value to future students we wanted to define some Students who solve the Lab and give Feedback to us about their experiences. To have some sort of comparable Feedback we created a Google Forms which contains many Questions about their experiences completing our lab and what they think about it. After getting their Feedback we are going to tweak our Labs with their opinions in mind.

\subsubsection{Test Subjects}
Our Test Subjects are like us in their 5th Semester at the Ost in Rapperswil-Jona. They also study Computer Science.

\subsubsection{Feedback}
The feedback we got was the following:

\subsubsection{Impact}
Based on the Feedback in the last chapter we decided to tweak some Labs to better suit a beginner. The changes we made will be described in detail in the following Chapters.
