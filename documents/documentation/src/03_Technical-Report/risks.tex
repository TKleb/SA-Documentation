\subsection{Risk Managment}
For this project, the ”Project Management Triangle” is lacking the cost dimension, while the time dimension is fixed (strict deadlines). As a result, any risks that appear, automatically lead to a reduction of the project scope if there is no spare time. Because of this, we will prioritize dealing with risks above regular tasks and prioritize essential tasks over nice-to-haves, but we do not intend on planning in a flat time margin as we have no way to negotiate for more time.

\subsection{Estimated Risks}
The numbers in the following picture describe the position of the risks on the following page from top to bottom.
