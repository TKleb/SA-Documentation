\section{Results}
We have achieved all the iteratively defined goals. \\
In the original project description was mentioned that ASLR and DEP should be a  part of the labs. We have updated these requirements in our continuous process of constructing the labs with their corresponding learning goals. While ASLR is included, DEP is out of scope for now and is better suited to be handled in the future continuation of this project, the bachelor thesis.

\section{Conclusion}
We were able to create the amount of labs wished and even had time to implement one more. It covers the basics needed for a smooth start into reverse engineering and also follows a common thread while posing increasingly difficult challenges to the solver. \\
This also acts as a fundament for future work and can be extended with more advanced reverse engineering excercises.
