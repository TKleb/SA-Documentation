\subsection{Testing}
\subsubsection{Procedure}
To be sure that our defined Labs have a high value to future students we wanted to let other students solve the challenges and give feedback to us about their experiences. To have some sort of comparable feedback we created a Google Forms questionnaire which contains many questions about their experiences completing our challenges and what they think about it. After getting their feedback we are going to tweak our challenges with their opinions in mind.

\subsubsection{Test Subjects}
Most of our test subjects are like us in their 5th Semester at the Ost in Rapperswil-Jona. They also study Computer Science. We also had one Student trying it from a different school and one in the first semester.

\subsubsection{Feedback}
Overall the feedback we received was positive. Often there were bugs or typo's which weren't a huge problem to fix. We didn't have to majorly overhaul a single challenge.

\subsubsection{Impact}
Based on the feedback in the last chapter we decided to tweak some labs to better suit a beginner. The changes we made will be described in detail in the following Chapters.
