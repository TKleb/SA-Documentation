Our process of working on the challenges in an iterating fashion seemed to work great and I would do it like that again. The hours invested each week varied by too much and I think we should somehow look for a more well balanced time investment. I also that even though we got some testing participants we should aim to test the exercises inside an exercise session at the OST. So the students don't have to sacrifice their leisure time to test our challenges.\\
The first week of the project I was still having one week left of mandatory military service. Because of this I want to thank everyone involved for their consideration. \\
I am happy with the final challenges and think that they cover good basics of reverse engineering and is a good entry point for students in the same position as we were. I am very grateful towards Gianluca Nenz and Thomas Kleb for their hard work and dedication they put into this project.
