\section{Project Plan}
\subsection{Project Overview}
The goal of this project is to create and organize a lab, which shows and explains future students of the Ostschweizer Fachhochschule (OST) how reverse engineering is performed and which tactics are used to get information out of a program. To accomplish this task, the lab will have several exercises organized in the different domains. These exercises will be accessible through the Hacking-Lab website. 

\subsubsection*{Hand-In}
The finished report will be handed in according to the rules set by the "Studiengangsleitung Informatik" and the supervisor:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The PDF version will be sent to the advisor and to the OST archive.
    \item The printed version will be handed in to the supervisor for reading and grading.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Management}
\subsubsection*{Time Management}
The project started on the first week of the semester (KW 38) and ends in week 51 giving us around 14 weeks to be done with the Hand-In. \\
Since the module has a total ECTS of 8 each of the students has to work around 240h during the semester which can be seen in table \ref{time_ects} together with the total planned time investment. This means, that per week each student should work around 17.1 hours.

\begin{table}

    \begin{tabular}{||c c c c||}

        Name & ECTS & Time spent per Week [h] & Total Time spent [h]\\ [0.5ex]

\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Planning and Project Management}
In the past modules Software Engineering Practices (SEP) 1 and 2  we were introduced to different ways to plan and organize a project. The main tools we learned, Rational Unified Process (RUP) and Scrum, are mainly used in software development but can be adapted to other projects aswell. They both use different aspects of time management and organisation which is why we intend to apply them to our project. \\
We use RUP to section our project into Inception, where we get a first insight into the project and how we want it to resolve; Elaboration, to plan our project, define the workload-distribution and setting up first concepts of the finished labs; The construction phase is mainly used to plan, build and test the labs while the last phase, the transition phase, is used as buffer and to finish our product. \\ 
To make sure everything works as planned we use Scrum with its sprints to setup milestones and tasks which help structurize the development. 

\subsection{Organisation}

\subsubsection*{Participants}
The "Studienarbeit"-Team consists of three students: Gianluca Nenz, Ronny Muel\-ler and Thomas Kleb. The work on the project and documentation will be evenly distributed between these three participants. Bigger decisions are made as a team in either the meetings with or without the advisor (the advisor will be notified on any change made).

\subsubsection*{Advisor}
The teams advisor for the "Studienarbeit" is Ivan Buetler who is teaching cyber security modules at the OST.

\subsubsection*{Division of Labor}
The project has multiple facets that need to be taken care of. This is why the team has decided to distribute the work load between the three. This doesn't mean that the work is done by only the chosen student but rather that he is the one responsible that it works as planned.

\subsection{Planning and Milestones}

\subsubsection*{Phases and Iterations}
The project is comprised of the four steps of RUP. Each of those phases has multiple iterations which create the different sprints for the project. The meetings with the advisor will be on thursdays while the team meetings will be held tuesdays. Each iteration / sprint will be of a seven day length.

\noindent We started the "Studienarbeit" before we began with the regular school. In the week before we each made research and plans about the upcoming project. After having a talk with the advisor it was decided to first find out the level of knowledge each student has to allow easier planning for the advisor.

\noindent The elaboration phase is used to plan and assess the possible risks in this project. This consists of a documentation structure, the project plan and the risk management to make sure the construction phase has no major hickups.

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{RUP: Construction Phase Planning}
    \label{construction_table}
\end{table}

\noindent To make sure enough time is planned a buffer week was added to the transition phase. This phase is also mainly used to finish up the documentation and implement the different challenges to Hacking Lab. The last week is used to clean up and hand in the documentation and abstract to both the OST and the advisor.

\subsubsection*{Milestones}
To guarantee the success of the project milestones were defined with a deadline.

        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Milestones set for the project}
    \label{milestones_table}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Time Tracking}
For time tracking the team has decided on using a third party application named Clockify \cite{clockify}. To have an overview on what the team spents its time on we decided to create different tags: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Documentation: Working on the documentation
    \item GitLab: Maintaining the infrastructure of the repositories
    \item Meetings: Sprint- and advisormeetings
    \item Preparation: Research before the start of the project
    \item RE-Labs: Creating the different labs
    \item Research: Researching for the labs
    \item Testing: Testing the labs with different volunteers
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Issue Tracking}
The issue tracking is done on GitLabs own interface to have as few difficulties as possible. To have an easier overview of the different issues the team has created tags to differentiate between the issues and their assigned student.

\end{figure}



\subsubsection*{Meetings}
The team has meetings each tuesday to elaborate problems and check up on the progress. These meetings are also used to distribute the work load. \\
On Thursdays the team meets the advisor Ivan Buetler to inform him on the progress done and the problems that came up. These meetings have different time schedules to fit everyones calender. \\
Each meeting will be documented and uploaded to the GIT repository. After each meeting the participants should know what to do and how to contact each other if any problems arise.

%\subsubsection*{CI/CD}

\subsubsection*{Projectmanagment}
The whole project will use a GitLab repository. To make sure no confusion happens a multirepo principle is used where one repository is only for the documentation and protocols and the other one is for code, information gathered, etc. Each student works on a branch and creates a merge request where the other students check the proposed changes for errors and when nothing is found, they merge the changes.
