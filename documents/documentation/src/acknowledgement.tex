This work was made possible by OST in Rapperswil-Jona. We thank them for the possibility to be able to work on such a project. \\

We thank Ivan BÃ¼tler for proposing such an interesting topic and for advising us throughout the process of this work. His insight and expertise greatly helped us to steer the complex path of reverse engineering. Also we are thankful towards Compass Security who made it possible to publish our challenges on their platform.  \\

We would also like to show our gratitude towards our testers, who sacrificed their leisure time to ensure the quality of our challenges. This is no small feat because they also had to work on their own projects. Their insights and feedback was integral to the quality of our product.
