# Reverse Engineering Lab Testing Manual
## Where do I find the challenges?
You need to create an account on the http://demo.hacking-lab.com Tenant. Then you can use the following access code ```JN4UW-EIDE5-XSXIY-ILXOT``` to access our challenges.

It is possible that the challenges can't load or that the steps can't load. This is possible due to this being the development Environment and a new update could templorarily break things. If it can't load the challenges or steps you have to try at a later time.

## Whats relevant to report?
When a challenge is not loading or you're stuck on a single step for more than 30 Minutes.

## I have to spend points to see the steps of a challenge
This is setup wrong. For testing purposes it's irrelevant how many points you get. Just use the steps as guide and use those points.

## What is the usual progression route?
Our Labs are supposed to be solved in a chronological order and are grouped in different groups:

Tutorials:
1. IDA, GDB and x64 Debug Introductions
2. static-debug
3. dynamic-debug

These challenges are supposed to teach you the basics you need to solve the harder challenges.

Challenges:
1. First Reversing Attempts
2. UN-PW
3. Pwntools Introduction

Advanced Challenges:
